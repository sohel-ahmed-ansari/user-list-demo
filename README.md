# User list demo

A small app that loads users from https://reqres.in/ and displays it in a list

- The app initially shows a pre-loader and loads a set of 10 users (Preloader will be shown for minimum of 3 seconds)
- When scrolled down, it starts loading the next set of users till it reaches total users from https://reqres.in/ API
- When you scroll down there is an indicator at the bottom of the list when it is loading

# Setup

- App is created using create react app
- It uses Typescript
- Prettier is used for linting and husy takes care of formatting when you commit code
- Added some tests as well. Used jest and react testing library

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs tests for all files

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
